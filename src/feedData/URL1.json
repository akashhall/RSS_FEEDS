This salad is testament to the fact that uncooked vegetables can be sexy. It’s scrumptiously crunchy, I could eat it every day. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Steamed Pokchoy Dumplings are stuffed with burnoise vegetables, delicate and packed with tremendous flavour, served with a sweet soy sesame sauce. They’re so light, one can down half a dozen without a sigh. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sweet Potato &amp; Pumpkin gallete was equally decadent served with a tamarind sauce, had a nice Indian foreplay to it yet tasted distinctively divine. </strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2396\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" srcset=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862.jpg 4032w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-300x225.jpg 300w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-768x576.jpg 768w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-1600x1200.jpg 1600w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-840x630.jpg 840w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-420x315.jpg 420w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-100x75.jpg 100w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-800x600.jpg 800w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0862-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coming down to the Sushi menu, I was obviously very greedy and ordered myself quite a variety. Kiara has managed to sneak in greens so easily in rolled rice, it’s almost effortlessly brilliant. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Spinach Cream Cheese Roll had me pining at the first bite, so rich in flavour yet light in composition. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Kaleage Roll is made with assorted vegetable tempura, crunchy and luscious, this one is a real hit with even those who swear they hate sushi!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Desserts </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date Crunch Rolls stood out for me, a beautiful culmination of dates embedded in crunchy pastry with smokey notes of sesame served with a drizzle of cranberry sauce. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kiara’s crisp Apple Crumble arrives at the table, looking innocuous enough with layers of sweetly caramelised apple bits between phyllo sheets. It’s Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a streak of miso apple ganache, looks pretty! </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Then we dig our spoon in and,boom! A positive explosion of crunchy against soft sweet apples on the palate is absolutely stunning. Much light on the tummy and an intelligent dessert I’d certainly like to have again! </strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-2397 size-full\" width=\"1125\" height=\"753\" srcset=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1.jpg 1125w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-300x201.jpg 300w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-768x514.jpg 768w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-840x562.jpg 840w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-420x281.jpg 420w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-100x67.jpg 100w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-896x600.jpg 896w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1003-1-600x402.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>•</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It’s safe to say that Kiara had a carnivore like myself eating out of the palms of my hand.

      "content": "\n<p>Before you go onto reading this article, let me clarify a few points.</p>\n<p>Travelling is a partially subjective and I believe each country has its own charms and is unique to travellers in terms of experiences &amp; culture.</p>\n<p>While writing this piece I had several discussions with many travellers who had mixed reviews to give on their travel to Vietnam. The country is beautiful with some great experiences to offer but if you’re a seasoned traveller, you may find yourself in lack of appreciation.</p>\n<p>I write this article to help fellow travellers have an insight into the country as Vietnam is and to make an informed choice of Travel as I personally feel if someone wants to take time off and travel in order to explore and rejuvenate, there are many other better options than Vietnam.</p>\n<p>I am not making swooping generalisations about Vietnam but expressing my personal disdain with my experience which didn’t quite live up to what I was expecting.</p>\n<p>•••</p>\n<p>Here are a few reasons why I’d advise travellers against visiting Vietnam.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Rude locals </strong></p>\n<p>The first thing to know about Vietnam is that the locals are preposterously rude. I know it’s wrong to label them all, but as far as my dealings went, I found them to be very unpleasant &amp; unhelpful. There is lack of basic etiquette &amp; very often you will notice the locals laughing at you &amp; making a mockery of the fact that you can’t understand their language. Yes language is a major barrier in the country. It’s extremely difficult to communicate due to lack of a common language, English isn’t easily understood.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Scams galore</strong></p>\n<p>The locals charge three to four times the actual rate of things to foreign travellers.</p>\n<p>The currency can be confusing and can take some time to get a hang of, until then you should be prepared to be ripped off! It’s not before 2-3 days you realise you have been over charged for almost everything! On top of that, the locals will be laughing on your face while they cheat you, yes the atmosphere is uncomfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>3. There’s not much to see or do in the country </strong></p>\n<p>Vietnam is beautiful alright but it doesn’t offer anything that made me go, “wow”!</p>\n<p>There’s nothing in the country that would make me want to go back.</p>\n<p>I did visit the popular sights in Ho Chi Minh City, and well they were quite over rated. War Remenents Museum was drab and very dull, because considering the rich history, I expected more. Chu Chi Tunnels weren’t that exciting either. I thoroughly felt that I wanted more from every experience &amp; my thirst for adventure wasn’t quite quenched.</p>\n<p>I was told Hoi An was exceptionally beautiful. Well, after a point I realised it’s a city made of lamps and that alone, there’s nothing more there.</p>\n<p>The famous lake center in Hanoi is average, kind of unpreserved. The shopping complex is nice, bustling streets but again, the night market is okay too but there’s nothing memorable or worthwhile there. All I remember is being ripped off at the Night Market after which I lost all interest in shopping.</p>\n<p>Halong Bay, is majestic but sadly the cruise we booked which promised a great deal, was horrendous, probably the worst night of my life where they served unhygienic dirty food and not much of an experience.</p>\n<p>The beaches are such a let down! I mean, c’mom I expected some beauty there, but they’re mostly dirty and unkept.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Food is disappointing</strong></p>\n<p>Ordering food at a restaurant in Vietnam is like disarming a bomb. You have to be extremely careful and every move must be precise and forget about explaining any specifications of your order. Further on I love street food and I understand what cooking conditions are like in less privileged countries – by that I mean I didn’t expect Michelin star dining, I mean I am an indian, and I can make do with the simplest kind of street food and appreciate it.</p>\n<p>However, in Vietnam, hygiene is quite unheard of. Local cuisine is prepared in tiny shops which are almost on the road, where the plates are rinsed next to a pile of garbage. I couldn’t satisfy my stomach due to lack of cleanliness. Local food is prepared in dirty spots. Only once in Ho Chi Mohan City, I visited a great night Food Market which was bustling with variety and hygiene wise, it was decent. I expected street food to be like that throughout but it sadly wasn’t!</p>\n<p>Coming to the flavours, the food in Vietnam is just sad. Barring a select few dishes I had in the city (which were reasonably delicious) the food was bland, mostly drowned in flavourless broths and scrawny seafood or meat. I enjoyed some Pho and Bahn Mi but eventually I wanted more and all I used to get was over fried greasy meat or lumpy sad noodles.</p>\n<p>•••</p>\n<p><em>So yeah, more or less my trip to Vietnam was disappointing because of several factors. I was certainly warned against a few matters but being a traveller I wanted to experience the country on my own. As evident, I didn’t like it as much I thought I would. </em></p>\n<p><em>The Asian country is cheap, infact very cheap, which attracts a lot of tourists but being cheap, I still felt I didn’t get my buck’s worth. </em></p>\n<p><em>The only delightful element of my trip was the cheap internet &amp; data plans which worked superbly, other than quick connectivity and the data services on local sims, I didn’t find much to rave about. </em></p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p><em>If you you plan on visiting Vietnam, do your research first. Don’t believe everything you see on the internet . </em></p>\n<p><em>I hope your experience will be much better than mine.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/2379-2/\">Here’s why I wouldn’t advice anyone to visit Vietnam.

      "content": "\n<p><strong>Barcat is the new delightful kid on the block, it’s quirky, fun and glorious with all that jazz, if you know what I mean! A jazz bar and every bit ubiquitous, hanging lights, large windows shining all the sunny glory onto the tables and smartly dressed up waiters in waist coats welcome you to this warm den of sunshine and seductive food! A pastiche of largely European flavours, it is tempered by Modernist sensibilities; expect a certain amount of razzmatazz on your palate. The menu is a warren of melting pots and inspired dishes.The Five Spice Peanuts come first, most addictively spiced, tangy, spicy and sweet all at the same time, they will leave your palate tingling for a while. Then comes the piece de resistance, Chicken Leg Mousse which sets the tone for the rest of the afternoon. Slow roasted piquant chicken mousse is spread atop toasted crusty bread and covered in a creamy layer of Welsh Cheese, it’s firm at first but melts delicately on the tongue as we prod further. Brilliantly cooked. <img src=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856.jpg\" height=\"1280\" class=\"wp-image-2341\" width=\"960\" srcset=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856.jpg 960w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-225x300.jpg 225w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-840x1120.jpg 840w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-420x560.jpg 420w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-300x400.jpg 300w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-100x133.jpg 100w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-450x600.jpg 450w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3856-600x800.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\">The Melon Melange Salad is delightfully fresh, juicy with an assortment of scooped melons and greens enrobed in a sweet balsamic dressing with goat cheese and sunflower seeds. I could eat bowls of this and not get tired! We delved into mains with a buttery Charter Pie, the toothsome fatty bits of creamy chicken get along with the sweet soft corn and onions inside the crusty flakey tart like a house on fire dotted with a red onion marmalade with a laugh salad adding a crunch to the textured dish— all making for a gorgeous mouthful.<img src=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829.jpg\" height=\"1000\" class=\"wp-image-2343\" width=\"750\" srcset=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829.jpg 750w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829-225x300.jpg 225w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829-420x560.jpg 420w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829-300x400.jpg 300w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829-100x133.jpg 100w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829-450x600.jpg 450w, http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3829-600x800.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\">Next up is the Grilled Chicken with a Bacon Potato Terrine, it’s as seductive on the palate as it sounds. Buttery skinned chicken grilled to a celestial perfection which makes it melt in the mouth with a velvety aftertaste basking in tremendous flavours of the lemon thyme jus and that bacon potato terrine ends up being gratuitous, given the amount of flavour these babies are packing, crunchy meaty yet soft in the center. Resembling a DTC bus by this point, stuffed beyond capacity, we soldier on to dessert.I notice the Philadelphia cheesecake and obviously go ahead and order it, cuz well, how can I not? Served with a berry compote, crimson raspberry jelly &amp; an almond crumble it’s pliant but substantial, without being saccharine sweet and just gooey in the right way. However it was the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart that had me swooning well beyond help and what a surprise it was. <img src=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_3852.jpg\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Soft, chewy chocolate in a buttery tart, surrounded by cloud blob of airy chocolate vanilla mousse. The spoonable dessert comes enrobed in a shiny chocolate glaze, with a garnish of toasted hazelnuts and, yes, more chocolate. I like to think of it as the fancy, chocolate draped dessert of your dream, each bite is a bit of manna, all the elements coming together in a symphony of sweetness that Gives way to a glorious gluttonous dark mess We finished in gratitude with a warm cup of their freshly brewed in house coffee, a stunner hot cup there. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bar Cat is flavour of the season and extremely exciting for those who understand Food and are always on a lookout for eccentric fun and decadent food. Trust me when I say this, those flavours are going to make you go weak in the knees more than once!</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/the-barcat-a-pastiche-of-european-flavours-and-dreamy-jazz-music/\">The BarCat: a pastiche of European flavours and dreamy Jazz music</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sukhmanisakhi.com/\">Sukhmani Sakhi</a>.</p>\n",
